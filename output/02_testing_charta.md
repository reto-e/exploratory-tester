# Testing Charta for Hotel Booking Page

## Goals

- Ensure seamless usability and functionality across all possible use cases.
- Validate the accessibility of the page for all users, including those with disabilities.
- Assess the security of user data throughout interactions on the page.
- Examine the pageâ€™s responsiveness and adaptability to language and device changes.
- Identify potential usability and security risks associated with core and auxiliary functionalities.

## Test Ideas

### Multilinguist
- Test language switching during different booking stages to ensure consistency.
- Confirm the page displays correctly in Cyrillic script without layout issues.
- Verify that translations are accurate and appropriately context-sensitive.

### Im Zug
- Toggle airplane mode on and off to check how the page handles offline situations during booking processes.

### DAU
- Leave input fields blank or enter incorrect data types (e.g., letters for dates) and proceed to test validation feedback.
- Enter unexpected input formats for fields, such as extremely long texts, special characters, and combinations of numbers and letters.

### Clicks on Speed
- Rapidly click the 'Book Now' and 'Check Availability' buttons repeatedly to test for debounce or throttling on action handlers.

### Slow down
- Engage with the page slowly to identify any timeouts or premature session expirations.
- Allow the screen to lock during use to observe how the page restores its state upon unlocking.

### Cancel Chancellor
- Interrupt processes at critical points (e.g., during CAPTCHA or payment) to ensure graceful exits and proper state management.

### Links
- Click all accessible links (e.g., Teams of Use, Privacy Policy) to validate navigability and correct linking.

### das Pendel
- Navigate back and forth within the booking process to check for redundancy handling and state persistence.

### Nur mal einloggen
- Introduce login errors, including incorrect CAPTCHA entries.
- Test simultaneous logins from multiple devices to ensure session stability.
- Attempt to use browser back after logging out to confirm proper session termination.

### Core
- Use the primary booking functions to ensure main user paths are efficient and logical.

### Orbiter
- Explore all functionality aside from booking (e.g., updating user profiles, FAQ, gallery) to ensure completeness.

### Paranoid
- Deny permissions that might be requested by the page (e.g., location, notifications) to assess fall-back mechanisms and user guidance.

### Heavy Rotation
- Rotate the device continuously during usage to confirm adaptive layout and retention of user input data.

### Marathon Man
- Use the page continuously without reset to test for memory leaks and degradation of performance over time.

## Exploration Areas

- **Forms and Inputs**: Focus on both booking forms and contact forms for validation and error handling.
- **Navigation**: Ensure easy and logical navigation through links and page components.
- **Accessibility**: Inspect elements for ARIA labels, appropriate tab order, and screen reader compatibility.
- **Security**: Execute security checks for vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF, and SQL injections.

## Risks

- Potential SQL injection through booking form fields.
- XSS vulnerabilities within the contact form.
- Privacy risks from inadequate data protection in communication forms.
- Usability risk from non-intuitive or inconsistent language switches.
- Loss of user data from lack of state persistence during device rotations.
- Session hijacking or unauthorized access risks due to session management issues.

## Notes

- Ensure all tests comply with GDPR, especially concerning data entry and transfer.
- Pay special attention to responsiveness, particularly for mobile users.
- All tests should consider different user environments and devices.
- Document discrepancies and user experience challenges with proposed solutions.
